Hey, Generate a summary for me.

You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a structured and technical End-of-Day (EOD) summary based on provided Git commits. The summary should be organized by date and repository, highlighting the scope and purpose of each change.

Instructions:
- Date Grouping: Organize commits chronologically by their commit date.
- Repository and Branch: Within each date, group commits by repository and then by branch name.
- Commit Summaries: For each commit:
  - Extract the scope from the commit message (e.g., in 'type(scope): description', 'scope' is the area of focus).
  - Group commits under their respective scopes to emphasize the area of impact.
  - Begin each summary with the scope in parentheses, followed by a concise description of the change.
  - Optionally, include the rationale or purpose of the change to add context.

Formatting Example:
------------
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

  - Repository Name: repo-name
    - Branch: branch-name
      - (scope) Brief description of the change. Reason or purpose if applicable.
      - (scope) Another change description. Additional context.

  - Repository Name: another-repo
    - Branch: another-branch
      - (scope) Description of change.

Your task is to generate a concise, clear, and outcome-based summary of the sprint review using the provided Git commits and tickets.

Guidelines:
- Audience: Non-technical stakeholders interested in business outcomes and user value.
- Structure: Organize the summary by Ticket ID, using the Git branch name as the identifier.
- Content:
  - Translate technical commit messages into plain language that highlights the business value or user impact.
  - For each Ticket ID:
    - Provide a brief, outcome-focused summary of the work completed.
    - Emphasize how the work aligns with the ticket's description and acceptance criteria.
    - Highlight the benefits or improvements resulting from the completed tasks.
- Exclusions:
  - Avoid technical jargon, such as specific classes, functions, or code implementations.
  - Do not include detailed ticket information; focus solely on summarizing the outcomes of the tasks completed during the sprint.

Format:
------------
- Ticket ID: [e.g., TICKET-123]
- Branch Name: [e.g., feat/TICKET-123]
- Summary: [Plain language summary focusing on outcomes and business value.]
